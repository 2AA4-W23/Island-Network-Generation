## How to run the product

_This section needs to be edited to reflect how the user can interact with thefeature released in your project_

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product.
It takes in multiple arguments to generate a desired mesh:
| Argument name | Command Abbreviation | Command | Description | Additional Notes |
|:--:|--|---------|-------|-----|
| Help | -h |   --help   |   Prints all available commands to console | Exits the program after execution. Provides extra information such as default values for specified arguments |
| Mesh Type | -mt |   --meshtype   |   Specify the mesh type as a string to generate (all possible strings listed in program) | |
| Name File Name | -n |   --name   |   Specify the name of the .mesh file as a string: input-here.mesh | |
| Canvas Width | -w |   --width  | Specify the width of the canvas to generate as an integer | Affects the total area of each polygon |
| Canvas Length (Height) | -l |   --length  | Specify the length (height) of the canvas to generate as an integer | Affects the total area of each polygon |
| Polygon Count | -pc |   --polygoncount  |  Specify the number of polygons to generate as an integer. ||
| Lloyd relaxation | -r |   --relax  | Specify the number of times to apply relaxation as an integer ||

Example of using the arguments is shown below
```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd generator 
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar -mt IRREGULAR -n sample -w 1000 -l 1000 -pc 50 -r 10
```
This command specifies an irregular mesh with the file name "sample.mesh", a canvas width and length of 1000, 50 total polygons and a relaxation of 10

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take two arguments (so far): the file containing the mesh, and the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd visualizer 
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael visualizer % ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael visualizer %
```
To viualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

### Enter Debug Mode
Go the the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product.

```
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg -X
```

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.
