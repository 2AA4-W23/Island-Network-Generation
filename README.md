## How to run the product

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product.
It takes in multiple arguments to generate a desired mesh:
| Argument name | Command Abbreviation | Command | Description | Additional Notes |
|:--:|--|---------|-------|-----|
| Help | -h |   --help   |   Prints all available commands to console | Exits the program after execution. Provides extra information such as default values for specified arguments |
| Mesh Type | -mt |   --meshtype   |   Specify the mesh type as a string to generate (all possible strings listed in program) | |
| Name File Name | -n |   --name   |   Specify the name of the .mesh file as a string: input-here.mesh | |
| Canvas Width | -w |   --width  | Specify the width of the canvas to generate as an integer | Affects the total area of each polygon |
| Canvas Length (Height) | -l |   --length  | Specify the length (height) of the canvas to generate as an integer | Affects the total area of each polygon |
| Polygon Count | -pc |   --polygoncount  |  Specify the number of polygons to generate as an integer. | Affects the total area of each polygon |
| Lloyd relaxation | -r |   --relax  | Specify the number of times to apply relaxation as an integer ||
| .obj Export | -obj |   --objexport  | Export the mesh in both .mesh and .obj formats | .obj vertex positions are a direct translation thus depending on the reader, mesh inversion may occur. .obj is exported with the same name and location as .mesh |

Example of using the arguments is shown below
```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd generator 
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar -mt IRREGULAR -n sample -w 1000 -l 1000 -pc 50 -r 10
```
This command specifies an irregular mesh with the file name "sample.mesh", a canvas width and length of 1000, 50 total polygons and a relaxation of 10.
Once the mesh is generated, one can move onto utilizing visualizer

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take two arguments (so far): the file containing the mesh, and the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd visualizer 
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael visualizer % ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael visualizer %
```
To viualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

### Enter Debug Mode
Go the the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product.

```
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg -X
```

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

# Assignment A3: Island Generation
### Generation
To generate an island:
1) Generate a mesh using generator.jar (It is recommended that you generate an irregular mesh with at least 350 polygons)
2) Run island.jar with command arguments below
   It takes in multiple arguments to generate a desired mesh:
   | Argument name | Command Abbreviation | Command | Description | Additional Notes |
   |:--:|--|---------|-------|-----|
   | Help | -h |   --help   |   Prints all available commands to console | Exits the program after execution. Provides extra information such as default values for specified arguments |
   | Mesh File Input | -i |   --input   |   Specify the mesh name (including .mesh) in your file system to read | If specifying a .mesh file from the same directory as island.jar, no file path is needed|
   | Island mesh File Output | -o |   --output   |   Specify the mesh name (including .mesh) in your file system to write an island mesh file to | If specifying a .mesh file from the same directory as island.jar, no file path is needed |
   | Island Generation Mode | -m |   --mode   |  Specify the type of island to generate | All island modes are listed by using the -h command. Normal mode is the main generation mode and lagoon will produce the MVP island |
   | Aquifer | -a |   --aquifer   | Specify the number of aquifers to be generated (as an integer) | |
   | Lakes | -l |   --lakes   | Specify the maximum number of lakes to be generated (as an integer) | This is a MAX number and strongly depends on the altitude of the island |
   | Rivers | -r |   --rivers   | Specify the maximum number of iterations for rivers to be generated (as an integer) | One pass will generate rivers where altitude difference is sufficient |
   | Seed | -s |   --seed   | Specify the seed to be used by the Normal generator |  This may drastically change how the island looks (to no island at all), it is recommended to play around with this value a lot |
   | Biome | -b |   --biomes   | Specify the biomes of island generation | Use -h to find out all biomes available |
   | Elevation (altitude) | -al |   --altitude  | Specify the altitude type of island generation | Use -h to find out all elevations available |
   | Island Shape | -sh |  --shape | Specify the shape type of island generation | Use -h to find out all shapes available |
   | soilContent | -s0 |  --soil | Specify the type of Soil Profile | Use -h to find out all soil profiles available | 
   | Cities | -c |  --cities | Specify the maximum number of cities to generate | A red dot specifies the entry point to a city. The darker the square, the more populated the city is. When creating a star network, oceans are not considered island land and thus paths between cities only via oceans are invalid and thus are not calculated. |
   | City Name Data Set Path | -d |  --dataset | Specify the file path containing lines of strings to use in name generation | If this field is unused then cities will generate with no names. If specifying a .txt file from the same directory as island.jar, no file path is needed |
   | n-order | -or |  --order | Specify the length of a given n-gram for city name generation | Must be greater than 0. Each possible beginning of a name will have this n-order length. If City Name Data Set Path is not provided, this field is ignored | 
   | Max Name Length to Add | -le |  --length | Specify the addon length of a given name for city name generation. | Must be greater than 0. The max length of the string is (n-order + addon length). If City Name Data Set Path is not provided, this field is ignored |
3) Run visualizer.jar with the outputted mesh from island.jar in island generation mode

Ex:
```
# First, generate mesh
mosser@azrael A2 % cd generator
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar -mt IRREGULAR -n sample -w 1000 -l 1000 -pc 800 -r 30

mosser@azrael A2 % cd ..
mosser@azrael A2 % cd island
# The following command specifies the generated mesh from generator.jar to convert to an island with 3 lakes, arctic biome, mountain elevation, the shape of a circle, a seed of 1234 and 2 river iterations
mosser@azrael island % java -jar island.jar -i ../generator/sample.mesh -o island.mesh -m normal --l 3 -b Arctic -al MOUNTAINS -sh CIRCLE -s 1234 -r 2


mosser@azrael A2 % cd ..
mosser@azrael A2 % cd visualizer
# Run visualizer on the generated island from island.jar and use the -ig command to specify island visualization
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../island/island.mesh island.svg -ig
```

## A4: Specific Commands
Alongside generating an island, one can also use the following commands when executing island.jar:
| Argument name | Command Abbreviation | Command | Description | Additional Notes |
   |:--:|--|---------|-------|-----|
| Cities | -c |  --cities | Specify the maximum number of cities to generate | A red dot specifies the entry point to a city. The darker the square, the more populated the city is. When creating a star network, oceans are not considered island land and thus paths between cities only via oceans are invalid and thus are not calculated. |
| City Name Data Set Path | -d |  --dataset | Specify the file path containing lines of strings to use in name generation | If this field is unused then cities will generate with no names. If specifying a .txt file from the same directory as island.jar, no file path is needed |
| n-order | -or |  --order | Specify the length of a given n-gram for city name generation | Must be greater than 0. Each possible beginning of a name will have this n-order length. If City Name Data Set Path is not provided, this field is ignored |
| Max Name Length to Add | -le |  --length | Specify the addon length of a given name for city name generation. | Must be greater than 0. The max length of the string is (n-order + addon length). If City Name Data Set Path is not provided, this field is ignored |
